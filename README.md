# üß± SOLID Principles in Java ‚Äî Explained with Real-World Examples

Welcome! This repo explores SOLID principles through clean Java examples, helping you build scalable, maintainable, and testable software ‚Äî in code and system design alike.

> üì¢ **Why this repo exists**

I have shared a post on LinkedIn about the importance of understanding the SOLID principles as the foundation of good system and software design.

If you came here from LinkedIn ‚Äî welcome! üëã  

If not, you can check out the original article here: [https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/solid-backbone-scalable-system-design-raj-kothari-ckt5f/?trackingId=Tey%2BurX6nXhf1Fjv8wW6mQ%3D%3D]

Let‚Äôs build a SOLID foundation together. üí°

## ‚úÖ What is SOLID?

**SOLID** is an acronym for five object-oriented design principles:

| Letter | Principle                         | Purpose                                           |
|--------|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **S**  | Single Responsibility Principle  | A class should have one reason to change.        |
| **O**  | Open/Closed Principle            | Software should be open for extension, closed for modification. |
| **L**  | Liskov Substitution Principle    | Subtypes should be replaceable with base types.  |
| **I**  | Interface Segregation Principle  | No client should be forced to depend on unused interfaces. |
| **D**  | Dependency Inversion Principle   | Depend on abstractions, not concretions.         |

## üìÇ Project Structure

Each principle has its own `.java` file with clean, commented code examples.

```

‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ SRPExample.java     --> Single Responsibility Principle
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ OCPExample.java     --> Open/Closed Principle
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ LSPExample.java     --> Liskov Substitution Principle
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ISPExample.java     --> Interface Segregation Principle
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ DIPExample.java     --> Dependency Inversion Principle
```

## üîç Code Walkthrough

### 1. [SRPExample.java](./SRPExample.java)  
- Demonstrates how splitting responsibilities (UserRepository, EmailService) leads to better separation of concerns.
- Use case: User registration system.

### 2. [OCPExample.java](./OCPExample.java)  
- Shows how to extend functionality via interfaces instead of modifying existing logic.
- Use case: Applying different discount strategies without changing core logic.

### 3. [LSPExample.java](./LSPExample.java)  
- Uses Bird/Ostrich/Sparrow to show how to avoid violating substitution expectations.
- Use case: Safe inheritance in polymorphic systems.

### 4. [ISPExample.java](./ISPExample.java)  
- Splits interfaces so robots aren‚Äôt forced to implement eating behavior.
- Use case: Clean abstractions for different actors.

### 5. [DIPExample.java](./DIPExample.java)  
- Injects messaging implementations instead of hardcoding dependencies.
- Use case: Swapping Email/SMS/Messaging backends with zero impact.

## üß† Why This Matters

Understanding and applying SOLID:
- Leads to **cleaner architecture**
- Makes systems **easier to scale, test, and maintain**
- Builds a **strong foundation for advanced system design topics**

## üöÄ Get Started

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/solid-principles-java.git
   cd solid-principles-java
   ```

2. Open in your IDE (IntelliJ, VS Code, Eclipse) or run with `javac`:
   ```bash
   javac SRPExample.java
   ```
